# Fake Twitter / X 

✔️ This project aims to practice my Frontend skills, being one of my first attempts with React JS. The focus is on recreating the Twitter platform page by page, striving to achieve a replica as faithful as possible to the original. As development progresses, key concepts of React and CSS are explored to enhance both design and functionality.

# Instructions to Install and Use Vite in a Project (English)

1. Install Node.js
   
    ✔️ Make sure Node.js is installed on your system. If you don't have it, you can download it from nodejs.org.
      
2. Create a New Project with Vite
   
    ✔️ Open your terminal and navigate to the folder where you want to create the project. Then run the following command to create a new project using Vite:

       ✅ npm create vite@latest

   ✅ You'll be prompted to name your project and select the framework. For a React project, choose "React".
        
4. Install the Dependencies
   
    ✔️ Once the project is created, navigate to the project directory:

       ✅ cd project-name

    ✔️ Then, install the necessary dependencies:

       ✅ npm install
        
6. Start the Development Server
   
   ✔️ To start the server and view your application in the browser, run:

       ✅ npm run dev
        
7. Build for Production
   
   ✔️ If you want to compile the application for production, run the following command:
   
       ✅ npm run build

This will generate optimized static files in the dist folder, ready to be deployed.
